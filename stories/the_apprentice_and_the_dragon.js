        "Wagons & Dragons – Side Quests – The Apprentice and the Dragon",
        "Written by Sean Wong-Westbrooke",
        "We begin deep in the bowels of a winding dungeon on the forested edge of the Dark Lands. At its heart is a spindly teen apprentice, training to be a powerful master of magic. A wizard! Or at least, that’s what he expected to become. Instead, he finds himself cleaning out a cave troll’s latrine.",
        "“Become an apprentice they said. Learn ancient wisdom! Learn arcane powers! Learn the secrets of magic! Apprentice? More like servant,” the teen grumbles while wiping his sweaty brow. “Twenty-seven. Twenty-seven gold pieces my dad sold me for. One stinking harvest worth, we had three good years in a row and he still sold me. Lousy fart is probably getting fat off my share of the food…” The apprentice’s grumbling is cut short when the earth begins to shake and the resident troll comes scrambling forth.",
        "\"Outta the way Zayne! Emergency! Emergency!”\n",
        "\"Yurg?! What’s wrong?! Are we under attack again?!”\n",
        "“No! Rotten eggs!” the troll quickly plucks the comparatively tiny boy out of the way and rushes into the latrine, shutting the great wooden door with a slam.",
        "Zayne throws his head back with a great sigh before covering his ears and eyes and tries to think happy thoughts, “You’ll be a powerful wizard one day. You’ll be tall and handsome.”",
        "“Zayne,” says an older man’s voice.",
        "\"Everyone will be begging to follow me and be my apprentice.”\n",
        "\"Zayne?” repeats the old voice.\n",
        "“I’ll live in a tower, not some stupid dank dungeon.”",
        "\"Zayne!”\n",
        "\"Ah! Master Wendel!”\n",
        "The almost ancient looking silver-haired man taps his foot on the stone floor. “Stupid dungeon, eh?”",
        "Zayne’s eyes suddenly find the mossy floor incredibly fascinating. “Sorry Master,” the boy sighs. “It’s just, when will my lessons advance? It’s been months since you taught me my first spell, I want to do more than make things out of ice. I want to learn.”",
        "“Yes, yes I can see that. I can also see that even after a year with me you still need to learn a little respect for the one who took you in. Now, clean out Yurg’s latrine once he finishes and scrub the floors from here to the entrance. You’re going to make this ‘stupid dungeon’ spic and span.” He moves to leave before calling back a last time, “Oh and bring me my dinner at sundown. Let’s have grilled salmon, mushrooms, buttered toast, and a pot of green tea tonight. And don’t be late!”",
        "It takes the boy all has to not sigh, “Yes, Master.”",
        "An entire day of cleaning later, plus cooking, and the apprentice has prepared his and Wendel’s dinner right to order. “At least I eat better here than back home,” Zayne thinks. The candle on the food tray gives an orange glow to the dungeon’s dark blue stones as Zayne goes down the staircase to Master Wendel’s lab and chambers. At the bottom of the stairs and down the hallway is a thick door of wood and iron, at its base is a slot for food to be slid through. It’s something Zayne would expect in a prison, not a study or lab.",
        "Suffice it to say, any sort of wonderment Zayne felt towards his apprenticeship, has faded. He looks at Wendel’s meal with disdain, should he seek out some petty revenge?"

        "Wendel’s dungeon is in the middle of a great forest, it is a week of travel along the roads to get from one end to the next, with only a few small towns scattered about inside. The nearest civilization is a small dirt road rarely traveled, as such, none but snake-men, the occasional desperate traveler, or adventurer ever come close to the dungeon’s mouth. On those occasions Master Wendel and Yurg repel them with ease. It’s been months since any incidents now but still Master Wendel says to not go out at night, “dangerous men and beasts blah blah blah,” but right now, Zayne needs a little rebellion.",
        "The spring air outside is comfortable, and the moon is high and bright. Zayne finds an old stump to sit and eat his dinner before just listening to the wind and the night bugs. It would be fully peaceful if he did not notice the sound of something lightly moaning.",
        "Always curious, Zayne tracks the moaning sound for some minutes before finally coming across a cave in a mountainside. The moaning ceasing as he draws close. The apprentice readies his pine training wand as he inches closer to the cave’s darkness.",
        "“Hello? Is anyone there? Do you need help?” Zayne says, stepping forward. A puff of warm mist is illuminated by the moonlight as a green reptilian head emerges with honey eyes. Zayne is frozen as the dragon comes closer. It is no bigger than a horse, though with a neck twice as long. Its green scales shine and its four limbs are thick with muscles. Its breath is like putting your face before a furnace. It would be like looking at a god, were it not for the creature’s distinct limp. The dragon tries and fails to hide the extent of its injuries. A whole swathe of scales is missing on its right side, revealing red and pink flesh beneath. The inside of its mouth is shining with small sparks as it approaches, keeping its head low."

He draws his pine apprentice wand and pulls the water from the air, forming it into a spear of ice that he hurls with a great yell. The spear lands square in the dragon’s wound and it roars in pain. Zayne can only manage to let out a short yell of victory before the dragon’s jaw unhinges with a sickening pop and the creature swallows him whole.",

        "Zayne runs as fast as he can from the dragon. The lessons from Wendel running through his head. “Armor like living stone. Claws like scythes. Breath that boils away lakes.” The teen runs straight into the dungeon, through the halls, down the stairs and starts banging rapidly on Master Wednel’s reinforced door. The door swings open and Wendel’s eyes are dark with anger. “Why do you disturb me?! What is it-”",
        "\"Dragon! There’s a dragon in a cave!”\n",
        "Wendel’s eyes go wide at the word, “What? Take me! Take me now!”",
        "Wizard and apprentice race back through the night towards the cave, the dragon is caught pacing outside the cave, watching its territory. On sighting the pair it spreads its torn wings with a roar Zayne cannot discern as angry or pained.",
        "“Get behind me Zayne, it’s mine!” Wendel draws his wand and the air goes dry as he surrounds himself with five spears of ice whilst the dragon digs its claws on the ground like a bull ready to charge. With a few words lightning begins to spread from Wendel’s fingers and wrap the ice with wild energy. “There is no getting away! I must know the secrets inside you!” The dragon’s eyes dart side to side, as if looking for somewhere to run, before its pupils sharpen and settle on Wendel with deadly focus."

It is short, Wendel opens with launching all of his sparking spears at the dragon. The dragon rushes forward and twists its body letting the spears strike the thick scales on its back. Swathes of scales peel away, revealing the pink flesh beneath, but with a bloody roar the dragon continues to advance. The wizard tries to form a golden shield of magic, but as he flourishes his wand once more, a burst of dragon fire disintegrates his wand and hand. The green and bloodied dragon tackles the wailing master and grips his head inside its mouth. The dragon breathes a storm of sparks over Wendel’s struggling form and almost instantly, his spark is put out.",
        "After finishing with Wendel the dragon slowly approaches the cowering Zayne who looks at the creature with horror and fear that he is next. He closes his eyes as the dragon’s furnace like breath washes over him. But no pain comes. He opens his eyes to see the dragon’s tail vanishing into the woods."

He makes a life for himself, a normal and simple life planting and harvesting the crops. A good life. Sometimes though, even years later, Zayne would use his small bit of magic to make statues of the dragon in ice and wonder where it had gone and what could have been.",

Zayne covers his head at the storm of rock but no pain comes. Above him he can see the dragon covering him with its back. Master Wendel is not so lucky, he is lying in a pile of rubble and struggling to rise while holding his bleeding head.",
        "\"Zayne! How could you?!” he calls out.\n",
        "“Let’s go!” Zayne yells to which the dragon nods its head. Together the boy and beast run into the thick woods, only barely illuminated by moonlight.",
        "As soon as Wendel recovers enough to follow he conjures spheres of light to track the escaping pair. “Come back Zayne! I won’t hurt you! Just give me that dragon! Come back, please!” The dragon tries to extend its wings, but it can only screech in pain at the effort. Zayne’s options are becoming limited as his master’s lights draw closer. In the darkness Zayne can see only a few possibilities. A campfire with the faint sounds of conversation. And a lone road to the nearest town bearing the sounds of a wagon."

        "Zayne knows he cannot do this alone. He needs help, and maybe, just maybe there is a group of adventurers able to fight off the wizard. He veers left, leaving the dragon confused as he goes for the campfire. Zayne has never felt so wrong when he sees four spear wielding snake-men hiding in the treeline, waiting to pounce on the passing wagon. Their torsos are like a man’s covered in scales bearing muscled arms ending in three-fingered hands, their heads and lower bodies are entirely serpentine. “We’ve been sssspotted!” hisses the largest one, an eyepatch wrapping its scarred head. In a split second their long bodies explode out towards the apprentice, their hissing chills Zayne’s bones.",
        "“What isss your busssinesss? Human?” hisses the one missing an eye, a red scar running down its head. Before Zayne can respond the green dragon emerges from the darkness and breathes sparking flames over the snake-men’s heads. “A dragon?!” yells One-Eye.",
        "The snake-men recoil themselves from the apprentice and bow down on the ground, pressing their faces into the dirt.  “Pleassse forgive usss, oh Great One. We did not know he wassss yoursssss-” the lead snake-man looks up and gasps, “Great One, you’re injured! Boy, what iss the meaning of thisss?!”",
        "At that moment Wendel emerges from the darkness and leans heavily on a tree. His grey robes are bloody and drenched with sweat. His eyes and hair wild with anger. “Zayne! Enough games!”",
        "\"He’s trying to kill the dragon! Help us!”\n",
        "The snake-men take up their spears without question and move to surround the wizard. “For the Great One! For the honor of our clan! Die Wisssard!” The snake-men’s spears come at the wizard from four directions, two press their slithering bodies to the earth and aim their spears for his gut while the other two circle the trees and go for his neck. Wendel waves his wand in a flurry as the weapons come for him. At the end of the flourish the snake-men spears do not hit flesh, instead stopping mid-air, their steel tips chip against a translucent golden film in the air that surrounds Wendel.",
        "“Try all you want primitives, spears are nothing to magic!”",
        "The dragon rushes to join the fight and breathes a torrent of roaring flame over the wizard’s shield, the flames heating the snake-men’s spear heads red hot. Wendel forms a fist with his left hand and his body shakes as he maintains his shield, in the same moment he is whispering old words to conjure another set of ice spears. Wednel’s power is great but his body is still old, the strain of so much magic is making his ears and nose bleed. The dragon fire is bending and distorting the magic shield, deforming it like a hammer slamming into armor over and over again, but despite it all, Wendel is smiling. His eyes glow white as he wraps his spears in lightning, “I’ve never felt more alive!”",
        "The dragon replies to Wendel’s boasts with angry eyes that quickly go empty as the dragon begins to sway, struggling to stand. Its stream of flame rapidly weakens until the dragon collapses, breathing heavily. With their god on the line the snake-men are unrelenting as they continue to stab at the weakened shield, all whilst staring down the wizard with nothing but bits of sharpened steel."

Zayne’s wand begins to crack and glow as his master’s shield cracks and shakes.",

What you did last night, you didn’t just show me raw ability, but the will to use it too. I was withholding your lessons to see what you would do, and well, I can see that I went too far. Considering you almost stabbed me. I’m sorry for that. You can leave, right now, no strings, and join that dragon in whatever fate you forge for yourself. Or, you can stay with me. I promise no more games, no more chores. Every day will be filled with spells, learning, all the secrets of the world. I will teach you everything I know. I will even give you access to spells I am too old to learn.” He extends his hand with a gentle smile, “So, what do you say, will you be my apprentice once more?”"

Just you wait Ziggurath, just you wait.” At the words and kind touch the sleeping dragon calms its moaning and wraps itself around the boy.

To Kahak’s relief Ziggurath much prefers ashes, char, and charcoal over expensive things like meat. With regular meals, a warm and dry place to sleep, and lots of love, Ziggurath is able to spread its wings wide without issue. The truest mark of Ziggurath’s health is that its green color has transformed into a shining emerald sheen on its scales.",

Ziggurath presses its body as low to the ground as it can and looks eagerly at them as it shakes its back."

Come to think of it, Zayne can’t really recall many stories not about something being slain. “Probably not the best bedtime stories for a dragon,” Zayne sheepishly says to himself.",
        "The teen thinks hard about where he could find a good story. He considers asking Master Wendel for a moment before imagining the almost inevitable chewing out he would receive. But, he does remember Wendel’s lab being filled with books and scrolls, piled up on shelves to the ceiling. “There’s gotta be something in there.”"

        "Zayne waits late into the evening, cleaning and polishing the dungeon hall outside his master’s lab until eventually the old wizard opens and stands in the threshold of the reinforced door as he lets out a wide yawn. “Oh, hello there Zayne,” his eyes wander over the practically immaculate dungeon, “You’ve worked hard today. Good work. Get yourself some food, but don’t stay up too late,” he yawns once more, “Goodnight.”",
        "“Yes, thank you Master. Goodnight.”",
        "Just as Wendel turns the corner to his bedchambers Zayne discreetly casts his ice spell and a small block keeps the iron and wood door open just a crack. Quietly he sneaks into the lab and is free to take from the great shelves. Zayne never had time for a solid look at it all before, considering Wendel’s usual nagging. But there is a feeling in the air, a majesty Zayne cannot ignore looking at all the knowledge. He tries to imagine the hundreds of lifetimes scholars spent collecting the information and he feels humbled before it. And maybe a little dirty for sneaking in to steal from it.",
        "It takes some time but Zayne manages to locate a book titled “Legends and Gods”. It is a thin but heavy book, weighed down by its metal bindings. Inside are stories Zayne has never heard of before. “The Faerie King Eyrek. Sato the Snake-Man. Dragonrider Elaine.” The book is filled with delicately drawn pictures that move ever so slightly, magic infused into the ink. This is the book Zayne needs.",
        "Quietly Zayne returns to the dragon’s cave with a candle and the large book. The green dragon pokes its head out of the shadows and cocks it to the side at the sight of the teen arriving in the dead of night.",
        "“Hey there! I brought something for you,” he says lighting the candle and presenting the book. “A bedtime story! I heard your kind like stories, and well, I think it might help you heal. It’s what my mother did when I was sick.” The dragon still looks rather confused but it nonetheless sits on its back legs and looks curiously at the book. Zayne begins to read the stories through the night, flipping page by page as the candle melts down into only a nub. The apprentice fails to notice when the dragon has fallen asleep listening to him before falling asleep himself. He awakens with a jolt at the first birdsong of the day.",

I’m so happy to see you taking your life into your own hands, I thought you were going to spend your whole life as my servant, poor Yurg’s been bored out of his mind.”",
