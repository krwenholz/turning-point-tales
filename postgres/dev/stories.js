          "It was a beautiful summer’s day, 70 degrees, with scattered clouds and the occasional cool breeze. It had been that way every moment, of every day, for the last 5 years, save for the pre-scheduled rain burst at exactly 12:01 to 1:35. People had, and continued to be, very particular about the weather. Some wanted downpours, others a gentle trickle. It couldn’t occur in the early hours, or too late in the evening. Every drop was meticulously orchestrated and accounted for.",
          "It had never rained in the morning, or on a Sunday. Evenings were off-limits, of course, and those times that had been chosen were only agreed upon after an arduous and lengthy process of debate. Each neighborhood meet on a bi-weekly basis to discuss the matter, always requiring a quorum, where all the minutiae of the day would be discussed and recorded in triplicate for the benefit of those later needing to review the proceedings.",
          "Mondays were already too difficult to even consider including spontaneous weather, and as Tuesdays followed Mondays, they were also a settled matter. Wednesdays were, and always had been, reserved for sport tournaments. Only once had it rained on a Wednesday, and that regrettable oversight led to a dozen ruined paint jobs, a hand full of arrests, and a panic stricken individual convinced they were drowning in the comfort of their porch rocking chair. Three emergency sessions later, and thru countless mountains of paperwork, it seemed the matter had all but been resolved through democratic debate. So for the interim Wednesday was strictly off limits for weather.",
          "Thursday and Friday were no better, as those leaving work were finally free to take the weekend as they wished, so rain was not a welcome sight there either. Saturdays, as one could guess, were busy catching up on all things left to the last minute. Sadly, that left Sunday, and only for a single slot of time. Only then could everyone nuzzle up during the lull of the day, and stare out their windows as the perfectly tuned and precisely executed downpour pounded the city for the pre-agreed up time of exactly 1 hour 36 minutes. Not one minute more, or one drop less.",
          "And above all this, orchestrating this weather, was a man sitting in an orthopaedically approved chair, in an air-conditioned room high above the city. Basking in the gentle loving glow of fluorescent lighting, in the midst of all this malaise, at the heart of all this weather, was James Icarus Banks.",
          "Mr. Banks watched the weather every day from nine to five. He was a weatherman, and he oversaw the most complex meteorological system ever devised, on board one of the most technologically advanced machines ever conceived. It was known as the Leviathan. His ship was accompanied by two others, The Memento, and the Ark. They were its sisters, each equally impressive in their size and achievement. A single ship stretched the length of New York’s Manhattan, as if a great knife had descended down and slipped into the earth, cutting away a raw slice of flesh.",
          "And with that wound left behind, that raw flesh bled life, seeping out to pool into thousands of schools, parks, homes, skyscrapers and streets. In those small corners of the ship, people lived, laughed, started families, died, were born, played music, competed, lost, flipped burgers, mopped floors, wrote stories, and lived their lives with only the thin hull of the ship protecting them from the oblivion of nothingness that was the expanse of space.",
          "And Mr Banks, who oversaw this triumphant testament of man’s ability to carve in the vast desert of space a single bastion of life, knew only two things would never change. The first, as he knew all too well, was the weather. The second was this; He was unbelievably, undeniably, bored out of his mind.",

HR had long ago been completely automated, all it's human inhabitants fired, layed off, or generally given reduced benefits to 'gradually downsize', and since replaced with self-help kiosks. Almost immediately, office satisfaction had gone up, as reported by the quarterly employee survey. It had been a smashing success, by all possible means of measurement, also supplied by the new HR department.",
          "Still, Banks wished there were a more convenient way to deal with internal office politics and general job satisfaction, but this was the way things were, and there wasn't much Banks could do about it. Getting up, banks headed to HR, by turning 45 degrees in his chair, reaching his hand out, and opening the HR-Self-Help Kiosk tucked away in the corner of his Office. Stepping inside, he closed the privacy door behind him, shielding himself from any discerning ears that might be listening in his private office",

Local mayers and leaders were concerned shifting forward would inevitably cause a mass mishap in late appointments, unbused school children in the wee hours of the morning, and congressional sessions that would interweave into pre-planned holidays.

Of course, that was unlikely. The investors of the Leviathan had spared no expense in its creation, save for Technical and Administrative personnel, many of whom refused to work on Sundays. They were a bit understaffed.",
        "On the screen in front of him, the time was 1:35. In one minute, the weekly pre-scheduled neighborhood association's Sunday downpour would end. He had to make the most of this time, savor every moment, or better yet, stop it from ending. Furiously typing, fingers flying on the keyboard, he entered out a single command, then hit enter. Waiting, holding his breath, the clock stuck at 1:35, unchanging. Every synchronized clock on the ship was stuck at 1:35pm, on a Sunday afternoon. Outside, the rain continued pouring.",
        "Spinning in his chair to stare at the monitors next to him, Banks watched as the gentle downpour outside continued past it's usually pre-determined stop time of 1:36. Basking in the gentle glow the screens, each monitor was a window into the different lives of the neighborhoods on the ship. Those neighborhoods, from the look of it, were quickly descending into chaos.",
        "Many of the streets were starting to show signs of flooding. The storm drains, normally well equipped to funnel water to redistribution centers, were no longer open. The storm systems were independently scheduled, using their own internal clocks for redundancy. It's system, and the meteorological systems, were now completely out of sync.",
        "On another screen, small shapes, which Banks could only assume to be children, were jumping in the small lakes left by the downpour. Around them, a sea of cars were beginning to form, their owners long having abandoned them due to a lack of visibility. It had been years since any cars were built with windshield wipers, as it neither rain, nor gusted. At Least, not without a schedule.",
        "A smile slowly began to creep up the sides of Banks mouth, as he eyes darted from one monitor to another.A man was shaking his fist at a cloud, using a waste bin as a makeshift umbrella. A woman was covering her dogs mouth, fearing it might drown, as the creature stared into the downpour, utterly and completely dumbfounded.",
        "And while the mayhem roared down on the city, banks began to lean back in his chair, and grinned a large toothy grin. People panicking, children playing, no one would be sure when, or whether, the weather would end; And that was exactly as Banks intended it."

We do not hunt monsters. We have another duty. Delivering food to the hungry. Clothes to the cold. Arms to the weak. Giving all safe passage. So long as our wheels spin, so will the world.”",

            "Outside the stable a great courtyard sprawls outward, lining up within it are three rows of fifteen wagons surrounded by men and women securing their goods. Or to be more precise, the guild’s goods. ",
            "“What are they loading?”",
            "“We are transporting the standard goods of alcohol, cotton, furs, and a half dozen families seeking to wait out the war in the Capital. All fine goods that keep you and yours well fed. But, the moneymaker, Gamon, of this journey is within the five center wagons. I’ve been collecting and hoarding special items these days. You two, shoo.” Sakurai waves away two young workers loading an armored wagon.",
            "“Of course, Master,” say the workers after loading the last chest.",
            "“Take a look Gamon” Sakurai says as he opens a chest. Inside the chest are tightly packed and secured jars filled with strange things suspended in green fluids. “Monster remains. Vampire fangs. Werewolf livers. Giant’s eyes. Undead ash. Orc brains. Mermaid Tails. Crushed dragon bone.”",
            "Sakurai hands the boy a jar of orc brain and he inspects it with wonder. “Five full wagons? How did you get so much?\"",
            "“I called in a whole cache of old favors and a sizable loan. I've been getting first pick of every creature corpse and organ brought into the bounty offices these last few months. These organs make for strong medicine and the King is paying generously for anything that could help against the Dark Lord and his armies.\" Sakurai takes back the jar of orc brains and returns it to the chest. \"Since the monsters united, the rarity and value of remains has been climbing rapidly. I’ve been hoarding, waiting until the prices were right. I have a buyer ready and waiting for me now.” The aging master places his hands on Gamon's young shoulders and looks at him with unblinking eyes. “I've invested heavily in this journey. I expect you keep an eye on these wagons, if anything happens, it will be your responsibility.” ",
            "That is a lie though. A caravan master like Sakurai has plenty of trustworthy and experienced workers watching their cargo, but it is always good to put a bit of fear in your apprentice. Keeps them attentive. The wide-eyed look of dread Gamon's face assures the smiling master that they’ve done a fine job of it.",
            "After closing the chest and exiting the wagon, the workers return and finish tightly securing the cargo. “Now, take a look here. The wheels are fairly new and the horses well-rested. The canvas wagons coverings have been waterproofed and the wooden walled wagons are strong. The special ones have iron sheets on the inside. Never leave a city with anything less. The lazy and cheap merchants die quickest.” ",
            "Sakurai leads Gamon to the head wagon, painted red so as to guide the others. “One more thing, what did you notice Gamon? What are the caravan’s numbers? How many men and women? How many are armed?”",
            "“Um…forty-five wagons. Ninety horses. Forty men and thirty women. Only thirty had swords and mail, but all have knives. Oh, and I saw a handful of crossbows spread among the wagons,” says the boy with only a few delays.",

It worked for me!\" Sakurai thinks to himself. Thankfully the bitter memories have sweetened with time, and Sakurai gives the boy an encouraging smile. The next hours are filled with the rocking of the wagons, Gamon’s cracking voice, and the light chuckling of the drivers and guards as Sakurai intermittently flicks the boy’s head for his mistakes. By the time evening comes Sakurai is thankful to have reached the Crossroads, his finger was starting to hurt from all the flicking. Already settled along the Crossroads are two other caravan parties setting up camp for the night."

The dining and drinking area hold the bulk of the revelers at the moment, followed by the wrestlers and card games. A burly man with a broken nose is already being dragged away by his friends in the makeshift arena. And Sakurai smiles proudly upon seeing that the first one to go broke and have to strip naked at the card tables wasn’t one of his men.   ",

No longer Caravan Master, but Guild Master. This might be my last time outside of a city,” he whispers to no one. The sound of cheering and laughing breaks the melancholy, and Sakurai feels as if there is a great voice urging him on. “Leave the wagons alone. Go and enjoy yourself.” When his feet begin to move as if on their own, the master does not resist."

The barrels of wine are strewn about the camp ground, beside them baskets full of cups and jugs. Sakurai makes sure to serve themselves a generous cup. With dinner acquired Sakurai takes a seat at the largest fire and those also enjoying a fine meal in a makeshift outdoor public house.",

With the food sticking to Sakurai's ribs he breathes a contented sigh. And the wine is sweet as candy. When he is done he closes his eyes and ruminates on the taste of spicy potatoes with just a bit too much pepper. Next, he lets the bard’s strings and voice flow take control. It is a lively but soothing song about coming home. It takes Sakurai into a sea of memories of family and old friends long past that leaves his eyes a bit wetter.

If any managed to escape, they are undoubtably running blind through the woods.

The goods are wrapped inside thrice layered sheets, they are tied up in the form of human corpses. \"No guard or tax collector should dare to disturb the 'bodies' of soldiers being returned home\" was the smugglers' reasoning for this method.

Mai spends her days recovering, but for at least a short time every day Sakurai finds her arm wrestling and gambling with boastful men downstairs. Said men then leave much poorer and humbler. All the while Bard sings his songs and plays his new lyre. The money is coming in as soldiers, mercenaries, and refugees pour into the Capital looking for a bed, food, and respite. In a time of uncertainty, such things are now among the most sought after blessings.",
            "A week after arriving in the Capital, Sakurai awakes in the night to what sounds like a thousand flags whipping in the wind. The smell of smoke and sulfur. And the booming sound of war horns blaring. He runs outside to the King’s Road cutting through the city to see in the distance the great steel door of the city gates glowing red hot. Outside the walls are towering plumes of flame and lightning illuminating the endless hordes in the darkness beyond the wall. It is a black and silver ocean of teeth, steel, and raging magic. Sakurai feels his hair turn white from utter terror, but he does not let himself freeze up. He retrieves everyone he can within the inn and directs them to mount their horses and wagons. Once again Sakurai, his companions, and a mass of strangers are fleeing in the middle of the night. They are heading for the northern gate and out of the city when the assaulted main gate finally collapses and the roars of man, orc, minotaur, giants, and dragons flood the streets. Gamon at his side, Bard and Mai in the back, and reins in his still strong hands, Sakurai adds in his own war cry, “Onward!”",

Bard, we’re staying.” All the rest but two decide to stay, the pair that leave say they are unwilling to make deals with a witch, no matter how kind she may seem. They drift off into the wet darkness with new supplies and all the best wishes those staying can offer. ",
            "The next four years are quiet. Melanie offers to teach what magic she can to all who are interested, but no one appears to have the aptitude or flexibility of mind to learn. None but Gamon. By his fifteenth birthday, Sakurai and the witch have become joint masters to Gamon. Her teaching him power and medicine, Sakurai telling him of history and business. The boy is growing tall and strong while Sakurai's hair has long turned grey. Only Sakurai, the boy, Mai, and Bard have remained the full four years. Life underground was too much for all the rest, eating nothing but plants and fungus. Away from many familiar comforts, they trickled away gradually. Only one raft remains on the docks and the time for it too to head on has come.",
            "Neither Sakurai, Mai, or Bard wish to die under a mountain, and it is no place for a boy to live. And so, farewells have been said and the last raft is being loaded with a month of supplies. Melanie gives Gamon a kiss on the cheek and a long hug before letting him go at last. His shoulders grow broader every day, barely hidden by his black robes. The boy wields a small staff now to channel his power, never did Sakurai think he would be raising a young warlock. “I’ll message you through the crystal ball, just like you taught me. I promise. Farewell.” Gamon says to the witch.",
            "On the raft Mai and Bard are securing the last of the supplies. Most of the monster remains Sakurai brought have either rotted away or were used in Gamon’s training. Now all that’s left is one chest of teeth and bones. Still worth a bit of money, if there are any buyers still around. “How things change,” Sakurai muses peacefully. Over the last years Sakurai has come to let go of his mercantile past, ready to live however he needs to. In the same time Mai has let her hair grow out long, she looks like the goddess of strength herself now. Bard has let his own facial hair grow out now, a puffy brown beard for which none not have the heart to tell him it does not suit him. ",
            "Gamon sets foot on the raft as soon as all is set and ready. “Do you remember what to say Gamon?” Sakurai asks.",
            "“Of course, Master.” The boy takes in a deep breath for a great shout. “Onw-”",
            "“Wait for me you fools!” yells Melanie from behind. She is carrying a barely closed suitcase and holding her pointed hat to her head. “I swear I will burn you all if you leave me!” she yells before leaping onto the shaking raft. "

The blinding light at the end of the tunnel makes Sakurai's chest go tight, \"Oh how I have missed this smell.\" The raft crosses the threshold and for the first time in years the party feels the warmth of the sun shine down on them.

Sakurai follows him to find Mai desperately trying to remove her heavy plate armor while being dragged along the bottom river bed. With their knives, Sakurai and Bard sever the leather straps of her suit until she is light enough to bring upwards. All three reach air as soon as the river deposits them all into the ocean.

The waves send the party rolling through the waters, up or down are lost to them until they gain the courage to open their eyes and look for light.

Row!\" The orcs' green arms bristle with power and arrives starboard to their ship faster than anything man powered could travel.",

Row you bastards row or we're dead!\" The ship moves almost like a flying fish as the orcs tear their way through the sea.

The crew of rowing vessel watches as the mountainous Leviathan lifts the one-hundred-meter cargo vessel of oak and iron into the air not with its tentacles, but two bony green arms that have risen from the depths. Its captain is desperately blowing a whistle, but whatever effect such a tool held originally, has faded now. Like cracking a crab leg, the Leviathan tears the hull in two and lets the crew and cargo fall into its maw before tossing the mangled and twisted hull into the water. \"ROW HARDER!\" The scarred orc commands. And by the gods do they. ",

Did you lose your whistle?\"",

Killed ten humans myself!\" The crew of orcs cheer in pride while the humans' eyes go wide at the news of destruction. \"The Dark Lord holds dominion over nearly all of the continent now. I gotta say though, you wizards and witches are really lucky, you and your followers got pardons for being human and land grants if you swore loyalty to the Dark Lord. Congratulations!\" Sakurai quietly thanks the gods that the sun has set fully now, so that the darkness can hide his horrified expression. ",

Thankfully for Sakurai's party, she and Bard are excellent liars and story tellers. The orcs are thoroughly entertained and they happily share a supper of fish stew, hard tack, and grog. After four years without meat and eating little but mushroom soups, for now, dinner is mostly grog. ",

Attached to it is a bright and vibrant city of buildings of brutal but elegant make, as if it were carved out of a mountain by dragon fire and hammer. The sound of songs not penned by men and the smells of unknown spices waft over the orcs' ship. Working the ports are a mixture of all kind of dark creatures doing things no human could have imagined except in jest. Merfolk are guiding ships carefully to their docks. Giants and trolls quickly load and unload cargo. Fairies are delivering messages.

It has been a painful journey, but in only a half-day more of walking the Capital is within sight from atop a high hill.",

The royal castle on the center hill has been caved in and a black dragon is digging through the rubble. The king’s banners have been replaced, now flies the Dark Lord’s. A white moon on a solid black banner. “We are lost,” gasps Bard. Suddenly the sound of shifting undergrowth surrounds the party and all but the immobile Sakurai takes up a knife. ",

The sounds of marching soldiers and clanking armor pushing through bushes and branches is almost suffocating. The clouds are replaced with darkness and torch light as the party is taken underground. The air inside the cavern is cold and wet and smelling of mold. Sakurai's caravan is led past hundreds of injured civilians and soldiers but are finally told to sit and wait down for a briefing deep in the cave system.",

Still exhausted, Sakurai struggles to make out what he is saying in the echoing mess of a cave.

Yet, there is something odd, Sakurai sees the visage of a woman in black armor, standing in the crowd, her raven hair falls down her back and reaches almost down to her knees. She passes through the crowds like a wraith as she kneels besides the wounded master. Sakurai can now see her her helmet and armor is wrought iron. It is the Goddess of Strength. She whispers in his ear with voice so sweet it is almost loving, “Did you like it? The power? Forcing your way through?.”",

From her palm spreads a red light and Sakurai's body is filled with painlessness and the freedom to move his broken and torn body. “Stand.\" Before Sakurai can even comprehend the order he is already at his feet. \"The merchant’s story is over. Show me something new.”",
